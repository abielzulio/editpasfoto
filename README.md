## Contribute outer layer

Make sure your outer photo is

- **Unique, not a duplicate of an existing outer**
- **.png type file**
- **Compressed**

A step to contribe your outer layer

1. Create a fork repo
2. add your outer photo at `/public/img/outer`
3. Create a new folder if your organization/university doesn't exist. Use a popular acronym name in lowercase `ugm, itb, ui, unpad`
4. Name your outer photo file in a order `1.png, 2.png, 3.png, ...`, this is going to be your `VARIATION_ID`
5. Add your newly added outer photo in a variable called `OUTER_OPTIONS` at `/data/outer.ts` with a format like this

```typescript
{
  // Your unique number in an order from top to bottom, not showed to the user
  id: 1 // number
  // Your outer name, showed to the user, format: "(UPPERCASE_ORG/UNIV_ACRONYM) (VARIATION_ID)", example: "ITB 1", "UNPAD 2"
  value:  // string
  // Your outer photo file path, format: "${OUTER_PATH_BASE}/(lowercase_org/univ_acronym)/(variation_id).${OUTER_FILE_TYPE}", example: "${OUTER_PATH_BASE}/itb/1.${OUTER_FILE_TYPE}", "${OUTER_PATH_BASE}/unpad/2.${OUTER_FILE_TYPE}"
  src: // string
}
```
